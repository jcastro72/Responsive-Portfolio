      <p> My name is Jacob Castro. I was born in North Bergan, New Jersey on January 12,1999. When I turned about three I then moved to Orlando, Florida and have been living there ever since.
          Since I learned how to work a game controller I have loved playing video games. Over the years it became my biggest passion and when I was about 17 I started competiting in competitive 
          events for call of duty. I stopped competiting a year or so later due to personal and family situations but once I am able to start a stable life I will once again start to compete.</p>
